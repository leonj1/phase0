# Writing documentation

Writing principles, tone, and style guidelines for all project documentation. Load when writing or reviewing any prose output.

## Writing principles

- Lead with what the reader needs, not background.
- Second person ("you") — direct, conversational, professional.
- Present tense — "the method returns" not "the method will return".
- Short sentences, short paragraphs — scannable over readable.
- Sentence-case headings — not Title Case.
- Numbered steps for tasks, bullets for options.
- Self-contained pages — link to supporting concepts but include enough context for readers who never follow links.
- Define by presence — say what something is, let that stand. "The facilitator conducts discovery across all three lenses" is complete on its own; adding "it is not a sub-agent" dilutes the assertion. Reserve negations for governance rules where the boundary matters.

## Tone — phase0 vision articles

Authoritative, declarative, polished. The voice of a practitioner who has done this — confident, precise, not hedging.

## Style guidelines

- Prefer bullets, numbered lists, or prose over tables.
- Positive assertions in principles, forms, and instructions. Negative assertions belong to governance and proofreaders.
