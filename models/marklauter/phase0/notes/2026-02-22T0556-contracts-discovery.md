# Contracts — the atomic unit of modeling knowledge

## Context

Discovered while renaming 'Ideas' in CLAUDE.md. The reframe from 'idea' to 'contract' revealed a three-layer structure that was already latent in the architecture.

## Body

A contract is a matched pair of files sharing the same name. The modeling file is the structural contract — what to produce or verify. The skill file is the behavioral contract — who the agent becomes. This led to a third layer: governance rules are verification contracts — how you check the obligation was honored.

Forms are communication contracts (artifact shape). Skills are behavioral contracts (agent stance). Governance is the enforcement layer, architecturally present but not yet populated.

The discovery also clarified the relationship between actors and skills: loading a skill is putting on an actor's hat. An agent embodies multiple actors by loading multiple skills. Drive compatibility determines what combines (interviewer + historian) vs what separates (creator vs proofreader).

These insights are recorded in DOMAIN-IMPLEMENTATION-PRINCIPLES.md under 'Contracts are the atomic unit of modeling knowledge,' 'Forms and skills are complementary contracts,' and 'Actors map to skills.'
