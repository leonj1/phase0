# Bootstrap the phase0 model

## What

Start actor-first discovery for phase0-the-product. Identify the primary actor (Builder is the working hypothesis from early sketches in `notes.md`), establish their conditional goal and value conditions, then run the designing-usecases agent on the first use case. This is the first real dogfooding of the system — and it tests the new preservation behavior (write-as-you-go, stub creation, note capture) under real conditions.

## Why

Phase0 has mature tooling (16 skills, 1 agent, scripts, contract pairs) but has never been used to model itself. Bootstrapping validates the system, exposes gaps, and produces the skeleton for phase0 as a design discipline — which is the book.
